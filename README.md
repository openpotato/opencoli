# OpenCoLi

The Open Code List Representation Format (OpenCoLi) is a standardized [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format for representing generic code lists. 

The main features are:

+ Generic definition of code lists and code list sets using [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
+ Support for versioning
+ Support for multilingual text strings
+ Support for internal references 
+ Support for references to external code lists
+ Support for multi-column keys and references
+ OpenCoLi documents can be validated against the [OpenCoLi Document Schema](https://github.com/openpotato/opencoli/blob/main/schemas/v0.1/schema.json).
+ Open Source

## Documentation

The documentation website is part of this repository. We have implemented it using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). It is published under https://openpotato.github.io/opencoli/.
