The main features are:

+ Definition of code lists and code list collections using [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
+ Support for versioning
+ Support for multilingual strings
+ Support for internal references
+ Support for references to external code lists
+ Support for multi-column keys and references
+ OpenCoLi documents can be validated against the [OpenCoLi Document Schema](https://github.com/openpotato/opencoli/blob/main/schemas/v0.1/schema.json)
+ Open Source

## Examples

The following OpenCoLi example documents are available:

+ [ISO 3166-2 Codes for Germany](https://github.com/openpotato/opencoli/tree/main/samples/germany.federal-state-codes-2024-07-12.json)
